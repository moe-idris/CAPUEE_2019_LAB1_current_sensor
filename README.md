# CAPUEE_2019_LAB1_current_sensor

This repository contains all the needed material to develop the first laboratory session on the course "Control and Automation for the Efficient Use of Energy" 

In this laboratory session we will build up an smart plug to monitor and control a home appliance such as a lamp, a hairdryer, a fan, and so on. 

In this repository you will find an `.ino` file and also a `.pdf` file with all the information you need for this session. 

Enjoy! :)
